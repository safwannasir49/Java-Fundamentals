## 💡 What is Java?

Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.

It was developed by Sun Microsystems (now Oracle) and released in 1995. Java enables developers to write once and run anywhere using the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

### 🔍 Key Highlights:
- Developed by: Sun Microsystems (1995)
- Owned by: Oracle Corporation
- Platform: Cross-platform (via JVM)
- Language Paradigm: Object-Oriented
- Applications: Android development, enterprise systems, web applications, etc.

## 🚀 Features of Java

Java is known for its versatility, security, and portability. Here are some key features:

- **Platform Independent:** Java code runs on any system with a JVM.
- **Object-Oriented:** Promotes modular and reusable code.
- **Simple and Familiar:** Easy for those with C/C++ background.
- **Secure:** Has built-in runtime checks and secure execution.
- **Robust:** Includes error handling and memory management.
- **Multithreaded:** Supports concurrent execution.
- **High Performance:** Uses Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler for speed.
- **Distributed:** Supports RMI, EJB, and other networking features.
- **Dynamic:** Loads classes at runtime as needed.

## ⚔️ Java vs C++

| Feature               | Java                                 | C++                                  |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Platform Dependency  | Platform-independent (via JVM)       | Platform-dependent                   |
| Memory Management    | Automatic (Garbage Collector)        | Manual (`new/delete`)                |
| Multiple Inheritance | Not supported directly (uses interfaces) | Supported                         |
| Pointers             | Not supported                        | Supported                            |
| Operator Overloading | Not supported                        | Supported                            |
| Security             | More secure                          | Less secure                          |
| Compilation          | Bytecode interpreted by JVM          | Native machine code                  |
| Use Cases            | Web, Android, Enterprise Apps        | System-level apps, game development  |

### Summary:
- **Java** is ideal for platform-independent apps and large-scale enterprise systems.
- **C++** is better suited for system-level programming and applications requiring low-level memory control.

## 🧰 JVM, JRE, and JDK

Understanding these three core components is key to grasping Java's architecture.

### 🔧 JVM (Java Virtual Machine)
- Runs Java bytecode and makes Java platform-independent.
- Handles memory management, security, and garbage collection.

### 🏃‍♂️ JRE (Java Runtime Environment)
- Contains JVM + core libraries required to run Java applications.
- Used **only for running**, not developing, Java programs.

### 🛠 JDK (Java Development Kit)
- Full Java development package: JRE + compilers + debugging tools.
- Used to **write, compile, debug** and run Java programs.
