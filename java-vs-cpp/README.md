# Java vs C++

Java and C++ are both powerful programming languages, but they differ in several important aspects.

## ðŸ†š Comparison Table

| Feature               | Java                                 | C++                                   |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Platform Dependency  | Platform-independent (JVM)          | Platform-dependent                    |
| Memory Management    | Automatic (Garbage Collector)       | Manual (new/delete)                   |
| Multiple Inheritance | Not directly supported (uses interfaces) | Supported                           |
| Pointers             | Not supported                       | Fully supported                       |
| Operator Overloading | Not supported                       | Supported                             |
| Security             | More secure                         | Less secure                           |
| Compilation          | Bytecode via JVM                    | Compiled to native code               |
| Use Cases            | Web, Android, Enterprise Apps       | System programming, games, etc.       |

## Summary:
- Java is better for cross-platform and enterprise-level apps.
- C++ gives more control over system resources and is preferred for system-level programming.
