# JVM, JRE, and JDK

Java's architecture is made up of three key components: JVM, JRE, and JDK. Understanding these is crucial for any Java developer.

## 🛠 JVM (Java Virtual Machine)

- It runs the Java bytecode and makes Java platform-independent.
- Manages memory, garbage collection, and security.
- Converts bytecode to machine code during runtime.

## ⚙️ JRE (Java Runtime Environment)

- JRE = JVM + Java class libraries + other files needed to run Java programs.
- It **does not** include development tools like a compiler or debugger.
- Used to run Java programs, not develop them.

## 🧰 JDK (Java Development Kit)

- JDK = JRE + development tools (javac, debugger, etc.)
- Needed for writing, compiling, and debugging Java applications.
