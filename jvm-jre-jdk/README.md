# JVM, JRE, and JDK

Java's architecture is made up of three key components: JVM, JRE, and JDK. Understanding these is crucial for any Java developer.

## üõ† JVM (Java Virtual Machine)

- It runs the Java bytecode and makes Java platform-independent.
- Manages memory, garbage collection, and security.
- Converts bytecode to machine code during runtime.

## ‚öôÔ∏è JRE (Java Runtime Environment)

- JRE = JVM + Java class libraries + other files needed to run Java programs.
- It **does not** include development tools like a compiler or debugger.
- Used to run Java programs, not develop them.

## üß∞ JDK (Java Development Kit)

- JDK = JRE + development tools (javac, debugger, etc.)
- Needed for writing, compiling, and debugging Java applications.

## In Short

<ol> <li><strong>JDK</strong> = <strong>JRE</strong> + <em>Development Tools</em> (like compiler <code>javac</code>, debugger, etc.)</li> <li><strong>JRE</strong> = <strong>JVM</strong> + <em>Libraries</em> (Java Class Libraries needed to run Java apps)</li> <li><strong>JVM</strong> = <em>Engine that executes Java Bytecode</em> (platform-dependent)</li> </ol>
